# Neural Network from scratch

Learn fundamental deep learning concepts by implementing a neural network using NumPy.

The forward and optimizers parts were from [Neural Networks from Scratch in Python](https://nnfs.io).

The backpropagation was from [Prof. Hung-yi Lee @ NTU](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ibJpTrp5mcE&list=PLJV_el3uVTsPy9oCRY30oBPNLCo89yu49&index=12) and CS 7643 Deep Learning @ GaTech


I might add discussion about different optimizers in training in the future.
